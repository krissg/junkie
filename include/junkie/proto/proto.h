/** @file
 * @brief Packet inspection
 *
 * Each packet received from libpcap is passed to a toplevel "capture" parser,
 * which then builds a small struct proto_layer describing the packet and handling
 * the payload to a child parser. This child parser performs in a similar fashion,
 * extracting from the received data the interesting bits, building another
 * struct proto_layer describing this parser and handling the payload to yet another
 * parser, etc... At the end, once a leaf of the protocol tree is reached, the
 * user callback is called with the list of all these proto_layers.
 *
 * Parsers are designed in order to be (as most as possible) independent on
 * each others. Their aim is to extract from the packet only the informations
 * regarding the protocol they implement (ie. the information that are easy to
 * extract in realtime but presumed meaningful for a large set of callbacks).
 *
 * Having independent parsers implies that every parser is committed to a given
 * behavior. For instance, every protocol parser must have a single parse
 * function receiving the relevant data from it's parent and its parent's
 * proto_layer (which can be used to inspect upper layers). This common
 * behavior is inherited from the struct proto that defines the behavior of
 * all parsers of this proto.
 *
 * We have several constraints/wishes to take into account :
 *
 * - we want to store all gathered informations on the stack so that we don't
 * have to handle memory allocation for these transient data structures;
 *
 * - we want a parser to be able to call several sub-parsers on the same data
 * if its unsure which parser should handle a payload;
 *
 * - for robustness we would like junkie to keep working if for some reason a
 * parser is unable to operate (lack some resource).
 *
 * Storing every information related to a frame on the stack leads to simpler
 * code (especially if a parser can call several sub-parser on the same data
 * and/or when multiple threads are performing frame parsing) but implies that
 * the final callback that should be called once the frame is fully broken to
 * pieces must be called at the deepest point of the parsing call graph. In
 * other words, the callback function must be called by a parser when it has no
 * sub-parser (notice that this function may then be called several times if a
 * parser try different sub-parsers).
 *
 * For generality we choose here to pass an additional parameter to the parse
 * method which is a kind of "continuation" to call when no more parsing is
 * required.  This allows a parser to replace this function by another one that
 * will perform any final action before calling the received continuation, and
 * is similar to netfilter hooks implementation (just to say it's not _that_
 * alien).
 *
 * So every parser (that have anything meaningful to communicate to a child
 * parser or the callback) build two structures on the stack : the specialized
 * proto_info and a proto_layer which links to the proto_info and to the
 * previous proto_layer.
 *
 * How can a parser call a sub-parser if they do not know each other ? Well,
 * obviously a parser must have some kind of knowledge of what other parsers
 * are available.  That's why the struct proto describing a parser is public,
 * so that a parser can spawn a new parser for this protocol. But that's the
 * only link that exists between two parsers, and apart from the case where a
 * parser look something into one of its parent's proto_layer then one can
 * safely modify a parser implementation without interfering with any other
 * parsers.
 *
 * Anyway, a dummy parser is created whenever a proto in not implemented or no
 * more accessible.
 *
 * FIXME: if a parser call several sub-parsers in parallel the continuation
 * will be called several times.

/// If your proto parsers are multiplexer, inherit from mux_proto instead of a mere proto
/** Multiplexers are the most complicated parsers.
 *
 * A parser is called a \e multiplexer if it have several children of various
 * types (ie. of various struct proto) and pass some payload to them according
 * to a given key. For instance, IP is a multiplexer that use the ip addresses
 * and protocol field as a key to choose amongst its children which is
 * responsible for the payload. Similarly, TCP is a multiplexer using the
 * ports pair to choose amongst its children the one in charge for a payload.
 *
 * Multiplexers can not be stateless, since each instance of a multiplexer must
 * carry a list of it's children; for performance reason actually not a list
 * but a hash. But many multiplexers share a common behavior : from the header
 * of their data, build a key that identifies a children, then lookup in the
 * children list (hash) the one in charge for this key, or create a new one if
 * none is found.
 *
 * struct mux_proto/mux_parser implement this common behavior, given a small
 * set of parameters :
 *
 * - the size of the key;
 *
 * - the max number of children allowed per multiplexer instance.
 *
 * The hash function being generic, only the key size matters and not the
 * actual structure of the key (as long as your key is packed_ (see jhash.h
 * and cpp.h).
 *
 * But yet there is an important difficulty to grasp : some stateful parsers
 * deeper in the tree may need to handle traffic in both direction in order to
 * parse the payload (for instance, it need the query to parse the answer, or
 * just want to repeat the query in the proto_info of the answer for
 * simplicity). This mean, for instance, that the same TCP parser that handles
 * the TCP payload from ipA to ipB also handles the payload from ipB to ipA
 * (and so on). In this very example it implies that the IP parser must use the
 * same key for (TCP, ipA, ipB) than for (TCP, ipB, ipA). This is easily done
 * for instance if the IP key is build with sorted IP addresses, for instance
 * storing always smallest IP first (this is actually what's done).
 *
 * But this TCP parser itself must pass its payload from ipA:portA->ipB:portB
 * to the same child than the one receiving payload from ipB:portB->ipA:portA.
 * This is where things get more complicated, since TCP cannot merely sort
 * the ports when building its key. If we were doing this, the same child would
 * also receive traffic from ipA:portB->ipB:portA, which would be a bug.
 * In fact, to build its key the TCP parser must know how the IP key was build
 * and respect the same order. In other word, the rule is : once the top level
 * multiplexer (here, IP) have chosen a way to store its bidirectional key then
 * all multiplexers deepest in the tree must build their keys accordingly.
 *
 * That's the purpose of the "way" parameter of the parse() function : once set
 * by the toplevel multiplexer, other multiplexers must use it to build their key
 * (and pass it to their children).
 *
 * Although quite abstract for the average C coder, once understood these
 * helpers allows to add other multiplexers very quickly and provides as a free
 * bonus SNMP statistics for all multiplexers (such as average collision rate
 * in the hash) and guile extensions available for tuning any multiplexers.
